         *  
         *  Parsing is separating a sequence of characters into token based on

         *      A token is a meaningful sequence of characters (e.g., word).
         *      Delimiters separate tokens (by default, whitespace (space, tab,
         *          new line) is the delimiter).
         *
         *  When we create a Scanner object, we have to specify the input stream
         *      (e.g., System.in which is the keyboard via the terminal window).
